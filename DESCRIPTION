Description: Implements the method in Behrouzi, Abegaz, and Wit (2018) <arXiv:1805.09840> to learn
			intra-time and inter-time conditional independence networks for ordinal 
			time-series data and mixed discrete-and-continuous time-series data.
			This package assumes a stationary process, where both instantaneous and 
			dynamic networks stay fixed over time.
